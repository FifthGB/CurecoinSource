Intro
-----
curecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 curecoin-qt (GUI)
 curecoind (headless)


See the documentation at the CureCoin website:
